[![Dependabot Updates](https://github.com/Mad-Star-Studio/Starlight/actions/workflows/dependabot/dependabot-updates/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Mad-Star-Studio/Starlight/actions/workflows/dependabot/dependabot-updates)

Starlight Engine is a 3D Voxel game engine written in Rust. It is designed to be fast, efficient, and easy to use. ***It is still in development and is not yet ready for use.***

It is intended to be compatible with Luanti (formerly known as Minetest) games and mods, but offers a more modern and efficient codebase with more features.

## Getting Started

### For Players

Please come back later - This engine is unplayable at the moment.

### For Developers

Ensure you have Rust installed on your system. You can install it from [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Clone the repository and run the following command to build the engine:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

To run the engine, use the following command:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

Visual Studio Code is recommended for development, as the project is set up to work with it out of the box. However, you can also use any other IDE or text editor, like RustRover or Neovim if you dare.
