# Frequently Asked Questions

<!-- Basic details -->
## What is the purpose of Starlight?

The purpose of this project is to provide tools and an engine to build voxel-based games. The project has the following goals in mind:

- **Modularity**: The project is designed to be modular, so that you can easily add or remove features.
- **Performance**: The project is designed to be performant, so that you can build large worlds.
- **Capability**: The project is designed to be capable, so that you can build complex games.
  - This includes features like the ability to handle immense amounts of blocks, entities, and more.
  - This also includes features like the ability to change *all aspects* of the game through scripting.
- **Ease of Use**: The project is designed to be easy to use, so that you can quickly build your game.
- **Developer-Friendly**: The project is designed to be developer-friendly. We aim to provide extensive developer tools and debugging features.
  - We include and use the `egui` library for runtime debugging tools.
  - With them, Starlight allows you to track various aspects of the game, such as the state of the world, the state of the game, and more - Visualized in real-time.

## What is the current state of Starlight? Is it ready for use?

Starlight is not yet ready for use. The project is still very early development (it begun mid-December of 2024),
and... Well, it can't run *anything* yet, we're still experimenting with the engine's design and features.

<!-- FLOSS details -->
## What is the license of Starlight?

This project is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0. You can find the license in the `LICENSE` file in the root of the repository.
Too long? This means that you can use this project for free, but you must share any changes you make to the project with others,
and you must attribute.
You can still use it commercially.

## Is Starlight free?

Yes, this project is free. You can use it for free, modify it for free, and distribute it for free. You can also use it commercially.

***If someone is selling Starlight to you, unmodified, with no other inclusions, packaged material or software, you are being scammed***. Report it to the project maintainers, or the platform you are on.
You are not being scammed if Starlight is being sold as part of a larger package, such as a game, however.

## Is Starlight open-source?

It's not only free as in free beer, but also free as in freedom (libre). This project is open-source, which means that you can view the source code, modify it, and distribute it. You can also use it commercially.

## Can I contribute to Starlight?

Yes, you can contribute to this project. You can contribute by submitting a pull request, opening an issue, or discussing it in Discussions. You can also contribute by sharing the project with others, or simply by using it and showing what you've made.

Also, we develop some of the dependencies, or at least contribute to some them. If you see a problem with one of the dependencies, you can contribute to that as well.

## What kind of games can I build with Starlight?

Starlight is primarily tailored towards making cubic voxel-based games - The classic example of the *kind* of game you can make with Starlight is Minecraft. However, you are not locked into making Minecraft clones - you can make any kind of game you like, as long as it is voxel-based.

There may be some features added later to allow custom management of voxel shapes, but for now, it is limited to world voxels.
So games like StarMade and Space Engineers? Not possible. Games like Minecraft, 7 Days to Die, and so on? Absolutely.

<!-- Story -->
## Where did you get this idea?

The idea for this project came from developers who got agitated by shortcomings in other similar voxel engines - Luanti, previously known as Minetest, being the most notable one. The developers wanted to create a voxel engine that was more modular, performant, and capable than existing engines.

Starlight aims to provide compatibility, or at least optional compatibility, with Luanti, so that developers can easily port their mods and games to Starlight.
This feature is not yet implemented, but is planned.

<!-- Is this X? -->
## Is this Minecraft?

No, this is not Minecraft. This project is a voxel engine, which means that it is a tool to build games with blocks. Minecraft is a game that uses a voxel engine to build a game. This project is not a game, but a tool to build games.

<!-- What can I make? -->
## Can I use this project to build a game like Minecraft?

Not in its current state, but yes, you can use this project to build a game like Minecraft. Potentially even identical to Minecraft. However, you must be aware of the following:

- You must not use any assets, code, etc from Minecraft in your game. Cloning Minecraft is fine, *copying* Minecraft is not.
  - You can *recommend* Minecraft, or that users adapt Minecraft textures ***locally***, just don't distribute them.
  - You can say it's a "Minecraft *clone*" if you like.
- You should not use the name "Minecraft" for your game, since it is a trademarked name.
- Avoid using the Creeper, as it (at least supposedly) is a trademarked character due to its recognizability and brand association.
- Read Mojang's guidelines for any other restrictions.
